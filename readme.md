# Dept® FS React Coding Exercise

We are gonna build an awesome spaceX app where the user should be able to see a list of launches and mark them as favorites and search them for their names.
For this exercise we will need a backend and a frontend part. Inside each folder you will find a readme with the instructions.

You will need to deliver a url to a public repo with the complete exercise. In case we need you to make a defense of the exercise a ~30 minutes call will be scheculed
